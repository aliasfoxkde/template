# Template
This is a a "Template" repository containing the tools and scripts I use on a regular basis for other repositories, 
so that the files can be updated and maintained in one place and an "update" script can keep the others up-to-date. 
Additionally, this "Template" contains the starter files, folders, and basic structure for a standard project. So 
basically, this is a repository designed to save overall development time. Maybe it doesn't save a lot of time, but
it adds up and maintaining things on scale can become cumbersome. This repository seeks to improve that and anyone
else is free to use it or the idea, hense using the MIT License. I thought it was clever and useful.

I'm planning on testing out the repo as is and doing a slight redesign to my other projects to work with it.

Best!
